# Accessibility

Accessibility means to make users able to use web applications even with some disability. The content needs to be accessible as possible, no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and how they access the web.

"The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability." (W3C - Accessibility)

There are some characteristics of an accessible application.
