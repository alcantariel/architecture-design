# Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

Is a markup language that tells the browsers how to structure the web pages.

It consists of a series of tags or elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

## Semantics

It refers to giving meaning to a piece of code, like "what purpose or role does that HTML element has?", rather than "how does this div look like?".
