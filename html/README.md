# Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

Is a markup language that tells the browsers how to structure the web pages.

It consists of a series of tags or elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

## Anatomy of an HTML Element

```html
<p>Drink water</p>
```

- The opening tag `<p>` consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins.
- The content `Drink water` is the content of the element.
- The closing tag `</p>` is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash `/` before the element name. This marks where the element ends.

## Semantics

It refers to giving meaning to a piece of code, like "what purpose or role does that HTML element has?", rather than "how does this div look like?".
